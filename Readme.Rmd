Intro
====================
This is an R-package for working with the Nature index for Norway. It includes functions for working with indicators and calculating indices, uploading data into a NI-database, and functions for visualizing indices (work in progress).

Install by:
```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("NINAnor/NIcalc", build_vignettes = T)
```

For an introduction, take a look at the vignettes in the help section:

```{r, eval = F}
help(package = "NIcalc")
```
